= MySQL Source

This repository contains a very simplistic "source" for riff streaming that
can connect to a MySQL server and emit messages as a result of SELECTing rows.
The TABLE of interest should have a column dedicated to marking rows that have
already been processed.

Refer to link:config/mysql-source.yaml[mysql-source.yaml] for an example of
environment variables used to configure the source. The `DATASOURCE` variable
should conform to a https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name[DSN].

## Installation
Prerequisites for the out-of-the-box experience:

* riff with streaming enabled
* an instance of KafkaProvider created, named "franz"
* a secret named `mysql-connection` with a `dataSourceName` key
* a table named `events` with columns `id` (PK), `contents` (string data), and `status`.
